            Any innovation or technology should fulfill the very need that led to its origin and bring real-life benefits to people. The same stands
            true for any type of progress in the business world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any positive impact directly or indirectly translates to improved financial performance. For example, CSR activities lead to higher
            employee motivation, better brand image, and stronger customer relationships. In the long run, these benefits lead to increased profits.
            In comparison, the advantages of innovative technology can be noticed quickly and are more significant than the rest.
          </p>
          <p>
            The same is true for FocusHub. Quick improvement in financial performance is observed in businesses that integrated their operational
            activities with FocusHub. For instance, Burger King fast-food restaurants reduced their cleaning costs by 9%. Through insights, they were
            also able to include specific clauses in cleaning contracts that interlinked payouts with performances. This allowed for optimum use of
            investments made in cleaning and hygiene with the best possible results.
          </p>
          <p>Your business stands to achieve similar or better results through systematic and structural integration of FocusHub.</p>
          <h2>Direct and indirect impact</h2>
          <p>
            As explained above, the positive impact can be direct or indirect, depending upon the approach and the change. To understand better, let
            us take the example of a fashion store, whose KPI’s can be influenced by business processes such as,

          <h2>How to verify the results of using FocusHub</h2>
          <p>To measure FocusHub’s impact on financial performance, the following approach is recommended.</p>
          <h3>Step 1</h3>
          <p>
            Identify the key KPI (or set of KPIs) and metrics that you want to track over a specific period. Set benchmarks before starting with
            FocusHub, against which future performances will be measured or compared. It is suggested to start with one or two KPIs and then expand it
            to cover all facets of the business.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 2</h3>
          <p>
            Create a checklist to control the operating processes that directly affect the KPI(s) and metrics selected in the previous step. For
            example, if you want to estimate units per transaction, then you can include the following questions in the checklist:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>The entire approved range of bags is displayed in the store;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The entire approved range of stoles is displayed in the store;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Display look is formed by the merchandising requirements;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>There is an approved assortment for cross-merchandising in the billing area;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The cashier offers additional goods based on the final billed amount.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Step 3</h3>
          <p>Choose multiple stores with approximately identical scores according to certain criteria:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Location (city, region);</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Store visits;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Monthly maintenance;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Number of personnel;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Sales volume and so on.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>It is suggested to choose an even number of stores from different commodity turnover clusters.</p>
          <h3>Step 4</h3>
          <p>The selected stores are to be divided into two groups:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Pilot (with seasonal/regular audits);</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Comparative (which will not be audited).</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The results of the stores in the second group will be required for analysis against the results of the first group.</p>
          <p>
            Set a task for regional store managers of the pilot group to monitor the UPT for a specific period (at least one month). Plan an audit
            schedule, which will be conducted on a thematic checklist (formulated in Step 2).
          </p>
          <p>
            The participating auditors should not only perform audits but also monitor the elimination of the identified violations, along with the
            dynamics of tasks execution within the checklist.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 5</h3>
          <p>
            After the set period, compare the results of the selected KPI in both groups before and after using FocusHub. The difference in indicators
            is the result of FocusHub’s performance. To maintain the authenticity of the test period, it is recommended to not inform store managers
            about their involvement in the trial.

          <h2>If you are looking for guarantees</h2>
          <p>
            Businesses are curious to know what kind of guarantees a technological innovation like FocusHub can provide. This curiosity can be
            answered with an example. The manufacturer of a hammer cannot guarantee that you will make more money with it. It is up to you to learn
            how to nail quickly and accurately, and you can do your job quicker, and therefore earn more money. So FocusHub can reflect a business’s
            shortcomings and even recommend possible solutions, but whether to implement them or not promptly is entirely the business’s prerogative.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a technological tool, FocusHub is convenient, efficient, and multi-functional. But it is still a tool that is managed by people, so
            financial results will depend on how effectively it is used by the workforce. On FocusHub’s part, there is consistency in the execution of
            operational standards across the entire organizational network. It maximizes business efficiency, resource utilization, and compliance
            requirements to increase profitability. It also provides leadership with analytics-based intelligence and workforce development tools that
            drive results. At FocusHub, our team delivers a personalized, simple, and cost-effective approach to growing your business.
